# filler_bot

I am bad at IMessage games, so i wrote a minimax algorithm to play filler for me!!
## Topics: Tree search, computer graphics
The premise of the game is that the 2 players start on opposite corners of the board, taking turns at picking colors, each turn absorbing the tiles of the color picked that are connected to their already claimed tiles.

The bot is practically unbeatable as far as i know, since its search depth doesnt have to be particualrly high to calculate every possible game outcome from the start.

In the example below, the program starts in the bottom left corner and I start in the top right
